<p>George Mauer joins us again for this episode as we discuss several topics around open source software. We talk about maintaining open source projects, understanding that maintainers are people too, should some open source projects really be considered open source and getting paid for doing open source. We end the episode with a discussion on package managers.</p><p></p><p>George's Picks:</p><p><a href="http://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2014-12-02-the-social-coding-contract.html">The Social Coding Contract</a></p><p><a href="http://www.slackeyeslim.net/">Slackeye Slim</a></p><p><a href="https://www.touchdevelop.com/">TouchDevelop</a></p><p></p><p>Kurtis' Picks:</p><p><a href="http://prose.io/">Prose.io</a></p><p><a href="http://hckrnews.com/">hckr news</a></p><p></p><p>Bryan's Picks:</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/uptown-special/id943946661">Mark Ronson - Uptown Special</a></p><p><a href="https://leanpub.com/ember-cli-101">Ember CLI 101</a></p><p><a href="http://www.hulu.com/blackish">Black-ish</a>
