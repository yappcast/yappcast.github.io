We talk about a lot of things in this episode. Eric Normand gives us an update on how LispCast is doing. We also talk about A/B Testing, which somehow leads to a discussion about REST,JSON, and HATEOAS. We then discuss Software Businesses, working in a team setting, pair programming and our ideal work environments.

We end our discussion talking about tech hubs and how New Orleans, just like the other tech hubs, will have it's own characteristics. Enjoy the preshow talk about Trello. We also have a public YAPP Trello board for listeners to include possible future guests and ideas for the show. Due to technical difficulties, Eric's picks weren't recorded. But we have them here:
