In this episode, Kurtis and I talk about some recent programming news items. We have a discussion about package management (mainly discussing how [Go](https://golang.org/) handles packages, [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/)'s package management system, [Hex](http://hex.pm), and [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/)), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2014/11/28/ruby-2-2-0-preview2-released/) 2.2, the possibility of having [soft typing in Ruby 3.0](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/9999), [Ember CLI](http://www.ember-cli.com/), [Flow](http://flowtype.org/), and future podcasts episodes.
